How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The changes are immediately shown reducing the searching time.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

    Save a lot more time and probably less frustrating since you always have

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: Saving at logical and relevant moment.
    Cons: May not save at the right place, have to think about saving.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    To make sure the the information is changed across all affected files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    By seeing all the saved versions we are able to compare both versions and
    see all the changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can compare each version and still keeping them allowing to to make
    any changes you want and revert if required.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
