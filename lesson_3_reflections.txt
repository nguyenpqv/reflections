When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you have a team and would like to work with them by sharing commits.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You don't always need the updated version or maybe you are not working
    on the same project there don't need it.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is to create a copy of someone's repository right in GitHub.
    Clones allows you to create a copy from Github to your computer or within
    your computer.
    Branches are labels given to a series of commits.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Allows to resolve merging conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would be using cloud storage such as Dropbox to share files. Copies would
    have to be constantly created and intensive communication with collegues
    to make sure the changes are compatible.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you collaborate and would like the approval of you collegue. The other
    person can double-check before merging together.
